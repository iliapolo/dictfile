## Motivation

A while back i was given a task to deploy a bunch of software components to an amazon EC2 instance:

* Graphite + Grafana
* Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana (ELK)
* Nagios
* ...
* ...

Immediately i thought to myself: "Hey, no sweat, im sure DockerHub has containers for all these guys!", looking up
the registery i indeed found containers for most
